## ðŸ’¡Overview

This repository hosts the code and findings of our comprehensive analysis of anime trends, preferences, and demographics, specifically focusing on data from the *[MyAnimeList platform (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net)*. We've delved into a vast dataset of anime titles, user ratings, genres, and other metadata to uncover fascinating insights into the world of anime fandom. Additionally, we're analyzing user interactions and behaviors from the MAL platform to gain a deeper understanding of anime viewership patterns and preferences.

- **Datasets**: The CSV files containing the datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/151TpnljhWU69pJwJpHWpDe2vbcxDAPrM?usp=sharing) or you can create your own [here](https://github.com/Sajid030/anime_dataset_generator).

- **Project Structure**: The project consists of two sections:
  - **[Anime Analysis](1_Anime_Analysis)**: This section focuses on analyzing trends, genres, ratings, and seasonal patterns of anime titles.
  - **[Anime User Analysis](2_MAL_User_Analysis)**: This section examines demographics, user preferences, and engagement with anime content.

## Key Findings

### Genre Preferences

We discovered which genres are most popular among anime viewers and how preferences vary across different demographics.

### Top-Rated Titles

By analyzing user ratings, we identified the highest-rated anime titles and explored the factors contributing to their popularity.

### Seasonal Trends

We uncovered trends in seasonal anime releases and viewer engagement by examining release dates and viewership patterns.

### Demographic Analysis

Factors such as age, gender, and location were examined to understand how they influence anime preferences and viewing habits.

### Recommendation System

Leveraging machine learning techniques, we developed a recommendation system to suggest anime titles based on user preferences.

## How to Use

To explore our findings and replicate our analysis, simply clone this repository and follow the instructions in the documentation. Feel free to adapt our code for your own projects or contribute to further research in the anime community.
